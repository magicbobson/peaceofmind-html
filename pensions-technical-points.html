                    <p>The value of pensions and the income they produce can fall as well as rise. You may get back less
                        than you
                        invested.</p>
                    <p>Transferring out of a final salary pension is unlikely to be in the best interest of most people.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>Think carefully before moving any pensions</h3>
                <p>Despite pension simplification taking place on 6 April 2006, pension legislation is still very complex.  The “Pension Freedoms” rules which started on 6th April 2015, have actually added new risks and further complications.  I will properly analyse your old pensions before recommend you transfer your pension, or make any changes.  It is vital that you take financial advice before you consider transferring a pension, as many plans have valuable guarantees that could be lost on transfer.</p>
                <p>To demonstrate high standards of competence in dealing with pensions your adviser should hold the G60 or AF3 Pensions qualification from the Chartered Institute of Insurance (CII). Both qualifications are set at an advanced level, ensuring that the candidate’s knowledge of pensions will be comprehensive.  You should also make sure that your adviser has this qualification.</p>

                <h3>What qualifications and experience will my adviser have?</h3>
                <p>Iain Crowley holds G60 and the higher level Diploma Qualification, and has over 20 years of experience in dealing with pensions and investments. Iain also has a great deal of experience working in a consultant role, as Pension Transfer Specialist for the larger Network firm that Peace of Mind Financial Planning belongs to.</p>
                <p>Iain is friendly and can explain the technicalities of pensions in an easy to understand and pleasant manner. See the Testimonials section and give me a call to find out!</p>

                <h3>Why do we feel it is important to offer regular reviews?</h3>
                <p>This is because the landscape of financial services is changing quite quickly. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is putting a great deal of emphasis on the “Treating Customers Fairly” initiative.   It matters to me that your plan performs well from one year to the next, and that you are happy that you understand how it is performing.  How often we will review your pension will be based around its fund size and what level of service you think you require. In practice a review is normally done as and when each customer would like a detailed update, and it will be done at a time convenient to you.</p>
                <p>You will benefit by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making sure that the funds continue to meet your attitude to risk.</li>
                    <li>Of the funds that&nbsp;match your attitude to risk, you will use the ones that have the criteria to be considered to have the best prospects.</li>
                    <li>As you approach retirement I will discuss whether you should consider protecting your fund’s value by phasing into more cautious funds.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the less investment time you have, the less risk you should take.</li>
                    <li>When the time comes, I will explain how best you could take the money back out from your pension. The various methods for doing this have just been made much more flexible, under the new rules. It is no longer compulsory to buy an annuity.</li>
                </ul>
