                <h3>What is an ordinary annuity?</h3>
                <p>An annuity is simply a financial product that will guarantee to pay you an income for life, even if you live to 130!   In normal circumstances you will receive 25% of your Pension Fund as Tax Free Cash.  The other 75% is used to buy the annuity, which means that you use this money to buy an Income that will last for the rest of your life. (You can have a joint annuity if you are married).</p>
                <p>The annuity provider will normally be an insurance company you may be familiar with. (For example it could be Prudential, Aviva, Just Retirement or Legal and General). The Insurance Company will guarantee to pay you that income for the rest of your life.   Nobody knows how long we will all live, but the Provider will guarantee to pay you the income for life.  The annuity is an “Insured” product.</p>
                <p>To guard against getting poor value for money, you can also include a guaranteed period.  This used to have a limit of 10 years, but it is now possible to have annuities with a 30 year guarantee for example.   As an example, a 30 year guarantee means that if you died after only 2 years, the money would continue to be paid into your estate or children for a further 28 years, so that your family could still benefit.   This can give great comfort that the insurance company will not keep all you money if you die early.</p>

                <h3>What is an Enhanced Annuity?</h3>
                <p>In simple terms it is like an ordinary annuity, but it will pay a higher income if you have any ill health problems. The annuity market has evolved considerably over recent years.</p>
                <p>You don't necessarily need to a have particularly poor health to qualify. Even minor conditions such as High Blood Pressure, being on Medication of some types, or even being a smoker now (o in the past) could provide you with a high income.</p>
                <p>If you have suffered from serious ill health at some point, you will be likely to receive an even bigger enhancement. Many conditions will qualify here, but the typical ones will include.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cancer</li>
                    <li>Heart problems</li>
                    <li>A Stroke (or mini stroke or TIA)</li>
                    <li>Diabetes</li>
                    <li>High Blood Pressure</li>
                    <li>High levels of cholesterol</li>
                    <li>Respiratory Problems (including Asthma)</li>
                    <li>Lymphoma, growth or tumour</li>
                    <li>Multiple Sclerosis</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are the main conditions, but many other conditions can provide an enhanced rate. The one time in your life when having any sort of health problem can actually benefit you, is when you are looking to buy an annuity.  I will be able to make sure you take full advantage of any health problems, to secure you a higher level of retirement income. Please phone or email for further details.</p>

                <h3>Investment Linked Annuities</h3>
                <p>This type of annuity has the prospect to provide a steadily rising income. It will be linked to an underlying investment such as a With-Profit Fund or a Managed Pension Fund.  Over the long-term this will provide prospects for the annuity income to increase.  This is important to help ensure that the income can maintain its buying power.  Inflation and rising prices will otherwise have the effect of gradually reducing what you can buy with an ordinary level annuity.  The income can fluctuate, and it can go down in some years too.</p>
                <p>For this reason they are best suited to people who have other safe sources of income, or those who wouldn't be adversely affected if the income were to drop in some years.    They are also for customers who are prepared to take some risk, and they are more likely to suit people who are a little more familiar with investing.</p>
                <p>However, some people may retire at age 55 and live until they are 95. With a potential investment term of 40 years, many people will agree that a link to the investment markets is sensible.  Imagine a job that provided no pay rise for 40 years..?!</p>
                <p>There are a number of important points to consider, and the overall “Risk” with these types of annuity can depend on how much income is being taken, as this can often be flexible.  I will be pleased to explain all of this in detail with you.  It is also possible to set up Enhanced Investment Linked annuities where suitable, as this brings together a number of worthwhile benefits.  A number of my clients have found this to provide them with the best “mix” of inflation linking, and getting the best possible rate based on their state of health.</p>

                <h3>How can I help you?</h3>
                <p>I have a wealth of experience in this field, and will know how to secure the highest possible income for you.  My service will extend to providing you with a written report that will explain the advice I give you in full.  When you are 100% happy with the advice, I will deal with the application on your behalf, keeping the paperwork for my Customers to an absolute minimum.</p>
                <p>Hopefully you can see that getting advice is vital! I offer a very personalised service, and will speak to you as the results arrive, and will show you various comparisons, and offer suggestions to ensure you get the very best annuity income.</p>
