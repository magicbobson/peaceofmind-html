                        <p>The value of pensions and the income they produce can fall as well as rise. You may get back less than you
                            invested.</p>
                        <p>Transferring out of a final salary pension is unlikely to be in the best interest of most people.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I will provide a first-class service for anybody who has a pension, or anybody looking to start a pension. However it is important to monitor and review your pension with you over the long-term.</p>
                <p>Where you are investing in Shares this will always be the case, and over long terms you will need to invest in shares to an extent, to provide returns that can outpace inflation. However I will be looking very carefully at the investment term you have, and your attitude to investment risk, to ensure that the balance between risk and reward is ideally suited to you.</p>
                <p>There are two Principles that I believe are essential for effective pension planning:</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-xs-1">
                        <span class="fa-stack fa-sm icon">
                            <i class="fas fa-check fa-stack-1x"></i>
                            <i class="far fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
                        </span>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Principle 1</h3>
                        <p>I will recommend that you use a good quality provider with all the new Pension Freedoms functionality, and low charges. Unlike many firms I won't recommend an overly complex or high charging pension unless you really need one. Low costs are important, a point that the Financial Conduct Authority is always keen to stress. However some pension funds are clearly better than others, and I'll be able to get you the right balance between low charges and above average performance.</p>                        
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-xs-1">
                        <span class="fa-stack fa-sm icon">
                            <i class="fas fa-check fa-stack-1x"></i>
                            <i class="far fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
                        </span>
                    </div>                    
                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>Principle 2</h3>
                        <p>Rather than only giving you advice at the start, I'll continue to review and monitor your pension's performance with you over time. Most people will want to have somebody they can speak regularly about how their pension is performing. It will after all turn into one of your most valuable assets. You are likely to need to switch funds a number of times to get the best from your pension, and I will arrange this as part of my service.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>How I can help</h3>
                <p>I am a specialist in all aspects of pension planning, and can also assist with:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Transferring and consolidating any number of old pensions into just one new pension, and offering the service mentioned above.</li>
                    <li>Your options when you come to retire. (Often this involves buying an annuity).</li>
                    <li>Taking the tax free cash from your pension. (If you are over 55, and if this is the best option for you).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I can provide this service to anybody in the UK.</p>
