                <h3>What are the problems at retirement?</h3>
                <p>Everybody with a pension pot (who has ruled out Flexi-Access Drawdown) should consider the “Open Market Option” when they retire, to ensure they get the best annuity available. This means that rather than opting for the first annuity being offered by the current pension provider, the whole market should be searched to make sure the highest income is obtained. The concept is very similar to getting the best rate on Gas or Electricity, but with a pension fund the sums involved are a lot higher, and it will impact upon how much income you receive.  It is also a decision that you can only make once, so it is vital to get this right.</p>

                <h3>Do most people search the Open Market for the best rate?</h3>
                <p>No – Many people just sign the forms that they get sent by their existing pension provider when they get to age 60 or 65.  This can be a big mistake.   Taking advice at this point is critical for many different reasons.</p>

                <h3>Enhanced Annuities</h3>
                <p>These can give a better rate (and a higher income) if you have even then smallest of health problems.  In my experience, over half my clients have been able to get an enhanced annuity, which means their income will be higher – for life.</p>

                <h3>How can I help you?</h3>
                <p>I have a wealth of experience in this field, and will know how to secure the highest possible income for you. My service will extend to providing you with a written report that will explain the advice I give you in full.  When you are 100% happy with the advice, I will deal with the application on your behalf, keeping the paperwork for my Customers to an absolute minimum.</p>
                <p>Hopefully you can see that getting advice is vital!  I offer a very personalised service, and will speak to you about the various results and comparisons, and offer suggestions to ensure you get the very best annuity income.</p>
