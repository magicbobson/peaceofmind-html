                    <p>Flexi Access Drawdown is another method of taking income from your pension. The key point is that
                        this can be done without the need to purchase an annuity.</p>
                    <p>Some people may feel that they don’t want to commit to an annuity just yet, however they would
                        like to take the 25% Tax Free Cash, but not yet take any income. It is also possible to take an
                        income, by cashing in the pension fund. Previously there were government limits around how much
                        income could be taken, but these have now been swept away by George Osborne’s “Pension Freedom”
                        reforms.</p>
                    <p>My own view is that taking an income in this way can be quite risky if you take too much, too
                        fast. This is the new risk with “Pension Freedoms”. Unless clients want income for a temporary
                        period, or if they have other sources of income to fall back on, an annuity is likely to be a
                        safer option. Where people take a high level of income it will be possible to exhaust a pension
                        fund, very quickly. I will be able to discuss these “Risk or Ruin” points with you to ensure you
                        make the right choice for now, and for the future.</p>

                    <h3>Tax free cash</h3>
                    <p>Many people want to access their Tax Free Cash as soon as they reach the age of 55. However it is
                        unlikely to be sensible to release the 25% Tax Free cash if there is no real need for it. Don’t
                        forget that a pension is a near “tax perfect” environment, so only take what you really need and
                        consider “Phased Drawdown”.</p>
                    <p>A relatively common approach is for people to take the Tax Free Cash while they are still
                        working, and while they have other taxable income. This avoids adding to your income tax bill
                        unnecessarily at this time. The remaining 75% to be taken in a suitable manner later on in life,
                        when earnings are at a lower level. Careful tax planning like this is possible with Flexi Access
                        Drawdown.</p>

                    <h3>Making the right choice</h3>
                    <p>Anybody considering Flexi-Access Drawdown should also be looking at temporary annuities, and
                        possibly the ranges of conventional annuities, not forgetting enhanced annuities and investment
                        linked annuities.</p>
                    <p>It can be bewildering, but as part of my approach I will be able to guide you through this,
                        looking very closely at your circumstances to ensure the best solution is reached.</p>
