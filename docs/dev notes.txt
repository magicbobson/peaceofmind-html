To deploy
---------

1. Push changes to Github
It has an action which will automatically deploy to Firebase (workflow triggers on branch 'master' — update if your default branch is 'main').

2. Or for quick test (local):
- Make sure you are in the project folder:
  cd C:\GIT_PROJECTS\peaceofmind-html

- Use nvm-windows to manage Node (install from https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases/latest):
  nvm install 18.20.1
  nvm use 18.20.1
  node -v
  npm -v

- Deploy with Firebase CLI without global install:
  npx firebase login
  npx firebase deploy --only hosting

- If you see permission errors or the CLI is scanning your whole drive, run with debug to inspect:
  npx firebase deploy --only hosting --debug
