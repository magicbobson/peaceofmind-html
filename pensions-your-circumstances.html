                                <p>Many people view pensions as being a grudge purchase, and will arrive at any number
                                    of reasons to avoid taking any action. There is also a large amount of bad publicity
                                    about pensions mentioned regularly in the media and press. In my experience this
                                    causes a lot of confusion in people’s minds, and creates mistrust in pensions. This
                                    is unfortunate because many people are missing out on good investment growth and
                                    important tax relief too. Many people are sure they would rather invest in property
                                    thinking this to be a better investment – but over recent years this has not been
                                    the case. If you have a look at the performance of an average Balanced Managed fund,
                                    you will be likley to conclude that the results look better than property value
                                    increases. Also now, the Pension Freedoms rules mean you can control how and when
                                    you take your money back out. It’s no longer true that getting the money back out
                                    has to be poor value or restrictive.</p>
                                <p>In reality a personal pension is just a savings vehicle that the government will add
                                    20% or 40% of your contributions too (depending on how much tax you pay). There is
                                    no better or more tax efficient way to save for your retirement. <strong>Clearly
                                        paying into a pension and looking after your own interests is a very good
                                        idea</strong>. But as there is no compulsion to do so, the retirement prospects
                                    for many will be bleak.</p>

                                <p>Large numbers of people have money in very old-style pensions, some going back as far
                                    as the 1980’s. This can mean that money is left to dwindle in increasingly
                                    unsuitable, old, expensive, inflexible pension contracts.</p>
                                <p>The key to the success of a pension lies in how well the underlying investment funds
                                    perform. A pension taken out in the 1980’s may have been suitable at the time, but
                                    things may change even after a couple of years. For example:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Your attitude to investment risk may change meaning that the pension funds used
                                        may no longer be suitable for you.&nbsp; Your changing personal circumstances
                                        and age will have an affect on this.</li>
                                    <li>The investment funds you use may now be performing poorly, whereas once they had
                                        an excellent reputation. This often happens where there is a change of fund
                                        manager.</li>
                                    <li>The economy and investment prospects generally can change. &nbsp;You may need to
                                        take stock of this in light of your own circumstances, and alter the way your
                                        pension is invested.</li>
                                    <li>Your pension provider may close to new business, meaning that service, fund
                                        performance and investment choice suffers.</li>
                                    <li>You may be in a with-profits fund paying very low bonuses. &nbsp;Some haven’t
                                        paid any bonus since 2003 and so are being eroded by inflation.&nbsp; You may be
                                        prepared to take more risk than this, instead preferring better growth
                                        prospects.</li>
                                    <li>You may not ever have had your Attitude to risk assessed, and you may be locked
                                        into a poorly performing with-profits fund. Some Co-op CIS, Pearl, Royal London
                                        and Phoenix with-profits funds can at times be particularly unsuited to the
                                        policyholders. The Aviva Pension Assured Fund is also quite common, and could be
                                        unsuitable unless the policy holder needs prefers a low risk, and is prepared
                                        for correspondingly low returns.</li>
                                    <li>Your old provider may charge unrealistically high charges in comparison to the
                                        modern pensions of today.</li>
                                    <li>You may have acquired several older pensions that you’d like to transfer to just
                                        one properly reviewed and managed pension. This will keep things more simple and
                                        easy to manage.</li>

                                <p>I can transfer your old pensions into just one modern low cost plan. The new plan
                                    will have access to thousands of Investment Funds, and be able to provide Flexi
                                    Access Drawdown. One inportant new feature is that of “Nominee Drawdown”. If you
                                    were to die early this would allow your husband/wife or children to receive the
                                    money into a completley tax free pension environment to take whenever they like,
                                    free of Inheritance Tax. This is a considerably better option than being offered a
                                    return of the money by cheque, outside of a tax free wrapper, and with no investment
                                    funds for future growth.</p>
                                <p>If you don’t have a pension yet, I can set one up for you. More importantly however I
                                    will speak to you regularly to discuss your changing circumstances and look at how
                                    your pension is performing. If changes need to be made to the funds you use I will
                                    arrange this for you.</p>
                                <p>Clearly you can’t always be in the very best fund, but my aim is to make sure your
                                    fund will perform above the average for the sector. If it doesn’t I will recommend a
                                    fund switch at our next review.</p>
